# Tycho Brahe Platform Desktop for Syntactic Revision

The Tycho Brahe Platform has a beta desktop version initially launched for **macOS**.

It has fewer features than the full server version and is available **only for syntactic revision**; i.e., editing and transcription are **not** available, but documents may be imported.
